You must create at least five types of object structured in a class hierarchy and using good OO programming
practices. Two of these objects should simply demonstrate the multi-touch functionality of your system and be
simple graphical objects: they should be an ellipse and a rectangle. The other three should be more complex
and are at your discretion. Three possible examples are 1) a set of media objects (with integrated controls) for
displaying pictures, playing audio and showing video, 2) a set of instrument objects (which can produce music)
in the form of a drum, a piano and a guitar and 3) a set of general purpose UI elements (e.g. menus, toolbars,
ribbons) expressly designed for multi-touch. Feel free to come up with your own ideas here.
Your system should support at least the following operations for each object:
• Translation: move the objects around the screen with a single-point touch gesture
• Resize: alter the dimension of the objects with a two-point pinch gesture
It must be possible to simultaneously manipulate multiple objects (e.g. resizing one while translating another).
Your three advanced objects should also support additional interactions, such as media control, music making
in general command input. These should be designed (including both input and display) with a “walk-up-anduse”
scenario in mind.
